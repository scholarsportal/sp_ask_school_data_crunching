## Features

- Comprehensive chat analysis across multiple dimensions:
  - Time-based analysis (hourly, daily, monthly patterns)
  - Operator workload analysis
  - School-specific metrics
  - Cross-institutional chat flows
  - Local vs non-local operator distribution

- Interactive visualizations:
  - Time analysis charts
  - Operator performance metrics
  - Seasonal patterns
  - Chat flow chord diagrams
  - Heatmaps and distribution plots

- Statistical analysis including:
  - Basic chat metrics
  - Response time analysis
  - Wait time patterns
  - Chat duration statistics
  - Correlation analysis

## Installation

```bash
pip install sp-ask-school-data-crunching
```

## Dependencies

- sp-ask-school (>= 0.3.9)
- lh3api (>= 0.2.0)
- pandas
- plotly
- scipy
- numpy

## Usage

### Basic Analysis

```python
from sp_ask_school_data_crunching import analyze_school

# Analyze a specific school's data
analyzer = analyze_school(
    school_name="University of Toronto",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31"
)
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from sp_ask_school_data_crunching import SchoolChatAnalytics

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = SchoolChatAnalytics(
    school_name="University of Toronto",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31"
)

# Generate specific visualizations
analyzer.create_time_analysis()           # Creates time-based analysis
analyzer.save_individual_visualizations() # Creates individual charts
analyzer.generate_chord_diagram()         # Creates chat flow diagram
analyzer.analyze_operator_location()      # Analyzes local vs non-local operators

# Get statistics
stats = analyzer.advanced_statistics()
```
